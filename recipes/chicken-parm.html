            <h2>How to make a smashing Chicken Parm:</h2>

            <p>Chicken Parmesan, also known as Chicken Parmigiana, is a <strong>mouthwatering</strong> Italian-American classic that brings together the savory flavors of breaded and fried chicken with the richness of tomato sauce and melted cheese. The dish starts with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which are seasoned, coated in flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and then encrusted with a mixture of breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese. The chicken is pan-fried to a <em>golden perfection</em>, creating a crispy exterior that contrasts wonderfully with the tender meat inside. Once cooked, the chicken is placed on a bed of marinara sauce, generously topped with shredded mozzarella cheese, and baked until the cheese becomes irresistibly gooey and bubbly. The result is a symphony of textures and flavors, where the crunch of the breadcrumb coating meets the lusciousness of melted cheese and the robustness of tomato sauce.</p>

            <p>The history of Chicken Parmesan can be traced back to Italian immigrants in the United States, particularly in the vibrant culinary scene of New York City. While its exact origins are debated, Chicken Parmesan is believed to be an adaptation of the traditional Italian dish Eggplant Parmesan (Melanzane alla Parmigiana). The substitution of eggplant with chicken was a natural evolution, influenced by the availability and preference for poultry in American cuisine. Over time, Chicken Parmesan has become a beloved staple on Italian-American restaurant menus and home kitchens alike, cherished for its hearty and comforting appeal. Its popularity has transcended cultural boundaries, making it a go-to comfort food for many, celebrated for its satisfying combination of crispy chicken, tangy tomato sauce, and gooey melted cheese.</p>
