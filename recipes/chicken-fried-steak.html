            <h2>How to make the best Chicken Fried Steak:</h2>

            <p>Chicken Fried Steak is a Southern comfort food classic that marries the heartiness of steak with the crispy and seasoned coating reminiscent of fried chicken. The dish typically features tenderized and breaded cube steak, which is pan-fried to a golden brown and then smothered in a <strong>creamy</strong> <em>country-style gravy</em>.</p>

            <p>The process begins by pounding the cube steak to tenderize it, then dredging it in a seasoned flour mixture, followed by a dip in beaten eggs, and finally a second coating of seasoned flour. The steak is then pan-fried until it achieves a crispy and flavorful exterior while maintaining a juicy and succulent interior. The crowning glory is the creamy white gravy, often made with pan drippings, flour, milk, and seasoned to perfection. The result is a comforting and indulgent dish that brings together the best of both worldsâ€”crunchy, savory coating and a hearty, meaty center.</p>
