Recipe website project in HTML.

First project that I'm doing as part of The Odin Project. Setup a basic HTML recipe website.

<!-- Will need to come back to this and update it once the project has been completed. -->

Okay, I believe I've finished the required. I have completed the landing page, index.html, and the following three recipes:

1. French Onion Soup
2. Chicken Parm
3. Chicken Fried Steak

index.html links to all three in an unordered list and each have absolute links back to index.html.

Each page also as two headings (h1, h2) and an image of the dish that is to be made.

All the pages also have two lists. One unordered list for ingredients, and the other is an ordered list for the steps to follow.

That should be the end of the project, until I revisit it for the CSS portion of the course.
